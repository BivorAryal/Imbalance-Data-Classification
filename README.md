      Classification on Imbalanced Data: Insurance Claim Prediction
A machine learning project addressing class imbalance in insurance claim datasets using Python.

Overview
This project tackles the challenge of imbalanced data in classification tasks, where the majority class (no claims) vastly outnumbers the minority class (claims). Using an insurance claim dataset (58,592 entries, 41 features), we:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize class imbalance and feature distributions.

Apply oversampling (to balance classes) and feature selection (to identify key predictors).

Train a Random Forest classifier and evaluate performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Result: The model achieves 99% accuracy with 98% precision and 100% recall for the minority class.
